The Credit Simulator is a web-based application designed to help users calculate and simulate loan or credit scenarios based on various parameters such as loan amount, interest rate, and repayment duration. Built on the Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) platform, the application leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the system modular, scalable, and maintainable.
